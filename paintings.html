    <h3>Paintings</h3>

    <p>Combining old master techniques with contemporary subject matter, Sven Van Dorst tries to depict the beauty of everyday objects. His still lifes are rooted in the Flemish/Dutch painting tradition of the 15th and 17th century. Trained in several private studios, Sven Van Dorst still refines his technique by copying paintings and studying technical analysis of old master paintings.<br>
        All subjects are painted from life, this direct method of observation is crucial to depict the object's soul and accomplishing a convincing three-dimensional effect. The painter tries to 'portray' the objects in front of him, rendering their texture and reproducing their characteristics. Many of the painted subjects have a history and personality; shoes of a friend, worn out gloves or an old paint box. These ordinary objects have an artistic quality that the painter tries to capture and show to the viewer.<br>
        Sven Van Dorst also paints portraits, life size or on a miniature scale. His fascination for the human face resulted in several delicate portraits.<br>

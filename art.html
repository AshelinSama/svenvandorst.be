    <h3>Painting Studio</h3>

    <p>The studio or ‘studiolo’ is a working space, the result of collecting mania and a pursuit for knowledge. I believe in the converging of several interests and disciplines rather than the limitations of specialisation. For this reason my easel stands next to my writing desk, in between bookshelves. I paint as a response to a creative urge, a quest for beauty and a nostalgia for the present. My admiration for the Old Masters brought me to the scientific analysis of their works and a close study of their materials. I like to ‘borrow’ their expertise to answer my many questions. Therefore the studio becomes a place to gather, to reflect, concentrate and create.</p>
